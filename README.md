# Loading & Unloading Subproblem — NuclearIC Challenge

This repository is part of the **F25 NuclearIC Challenge** organized by the [Ideas Clinic, University of Waterloo](https://github.com/IdeasClinicUWaterloo/F25-NuclearIC/tree/main).

It implements a **real-time personnel detection and alert system** that integrates **YOLOv8 object detection** and **Arduino hardware feedback** to identify unauthorized personnel during nuclear material loading and unloading operations.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project enhances operational safety using a combination of **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **embedded control**.

- The **YOLOv8 model** detects and classifies personnel as *Authorized* or *Unauthorized*.  
- If *Unauthorized* personnel are detected for **3 continuous seconds**, the **Arduino buzzer** activates automatically.  
- Provides both **visual** (bounding boxes) and **audible** (buzzer) alerts for real-time awareness.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Object Detection:** YOLOv8 model distinguishes authorized vs unauthorized personnel.  
- **Live Feed:** OpenCV enables real-time object tracking.  
- **Hardware Integration:** Serial communication between Python and Arduino.  
- **Buzzer Feedback:** Arduino buzzer rings for 3 seconds when unauthorized personnel appear.  
- **Configurable Thresholds:** Detection sensitivity and timing easily adjustable.  
- **Optional Sensors:** Supports DFRobot BMX160 and IR modules for motion detection.

## ⚙️ Dependencies

### Python

Install dependencies:
```

pip install ultralytics opencv-python pyserial

```

### Arduino

- Library: **DFRobot_BMX160** (optional IMU)  
- Works with both **active** and **passive** buzzers  

---

## 🔌 Usage

### Step 1 – Clone the Repository
```

git clone [https://github.com/Mayalevich/LoadingUnloading.git](https://github.com/Mayalevich/LoadingUnloading.git)
cd LoadingUnloading

```

### Step 2 – Connect Arduino
1. Plug in your Arduino via USB.  
2. Check connection:
```

ls /dev/cu.*

```
Example: `/dev/cu.usbmodem1101`  
3. Upload the sketch using Arduino IDE:  
`Arduino/arduino_buzzer.ino`

### Step 3 – Run Detection
```

python main.py

```
- The camera feed will open.  
- Press **q** to quit.  
- If “Unauthorized” is detected, the buzzer will sound for **3 seconds**.

### Step 4 – Monitor + Arduino Connection
```

python monitor_and_buzz.py

```
Continuously monitors YOLO output, detects “Unauthorized” labels, and sends commands to the Arduino.

## 🧪 Testing the Buzzer

You can test the Arduino connection manually:
```

python serial_buzzer.py

```

Expected Output:
```

Connected to Arduino on /dev/cu.usbmodem1101
Testing buzzer (short tone)...
Simulating unauthorized event -> beep 3s
Arduino: TEST 0.5s | BEEP 3s | BUZZ END

```

## 🧬 Model Information

- **Framework:** Ultralytics YOLOv8  
- **Dataset:** Authorized vs Unauthorized personnel images  
- **Training Path:** `Loading_Unloading_Training_Files/train`  
- **Weights File:** `best.pt` (excluded from repo due to size)

## 🧱 Hardware Setup

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Arduino Uno/Nano** | Controls the buzzer and handles serial input |
| **Buzzer** | Active/passive buzzer on digital pin D5 |
| **IR Sensor (optional)** | Analog input on A0 |
| **BMX160 (optional)** | Accelerometer + Gyroscope via I2C (A4/A5) |

**Wiring Summary:**  
- D5 → Buzzer (+)  
- GND → Buzzer (−)  
- A4/A5 → SDA/SCL (IMU connection)
